This is the code for my capstone project at UW Bothell.

This is a slightly modifed version of OpenSubspace. I am using it in my research
on subspace clustering.

Here's a reference to OpenSubspace:

Müller E., Günnemann S., Assent I., Seidl T.:
Evaluating Clustering in Subspace Projections of High Dimensional Data

In Proc. 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB 2009), Lyon, France. (2009) 


If you want to check out the Evaluator (it's a runnable jar file in the main folder of the project) you can run it from the command line with

java -jar Evaluator.jar

This should spit out a help message that tells you what arguments to pass in order to run an evaluation of an algorithm on a given data set. For example,

java -Xmx1024m -jar evaluator.jar -sc Sepc -t Databases/synth_dbsizescale/S1500.arff -T Databases/synth_dbsizescale/S1500.true -c last -M Accuracy:CE:ClusterDistribution:Coverage:Entropy:F1Measure:RNIA -timelimit 30 -a 0.05 -b 0.3 -w 100 -e 0.01 -m 0 -n 0 -s 0.5 -x true 

Will run SEPC on one of the synthetic data sets and calculate all of the metrics (the results are going to be written to standard out).
