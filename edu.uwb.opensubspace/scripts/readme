Parameter Tuning Scripts

Some notes on running the scripts in this directory.


To run the scripts remotely while logged off use the following command:

	nohup sh scipt-name.sh 2> nohup.err < /dev/null &

Then you don't have to maintain your ssh session in order for the script to continue running.
Alternatively, use the run.sh script which just does the above with a passed tuning script.
	
	./run.sh script-name

In addition, run.sh redirects the outputs thusly

	1> log/script-name.out
	2> log/script-name.err

This makes it a little easier to check on the status of individual algorithms.


If you don't want to call the script using 'sh script-name' then you can make the script executable using 

chmod +x script-name

Useful for copying files to/from the server. A little easier than ftp.
scp mineclus-real.sh hunnd@uw1-320-lab.uwb.edu:/net/metis/home2/hunnd/edu.uwb.opensubspace/scripts
